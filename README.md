# SimplePhpFramework
Desciption: This is my own PHP framework. It has the url parser so it automatically calls the right controllers.
It also has a signup and login and some validation. It also has two simple apps: notepad and shoutbox where you can add and remove notes and shouts. Feel free to add features :).
